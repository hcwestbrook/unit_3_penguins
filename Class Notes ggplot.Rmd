```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

The conflicts that pop up mean there is masking, which means that some of the funtions in the tidyverse already have the same name as functions in base R
The most recent thing that has been loaded is the version of the function that will be used
You can know which function you're using with the find function

```{r}
find("filter") #first one listed is the default 

library(palmerpenguins)

```
